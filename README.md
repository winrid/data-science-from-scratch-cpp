# data-science-from-scratch-cpp
The exercises from the book "Data Science from Scratch" - but in C++17 instead of Python.

### Why would you hurt yourself this way?

C++ isn't going away anytime soon. While I'd pick Rust for most new projects,
knowing C++ is a useful tool for diving into all different kinds of existing systems. Also, "Modern C++" is pretty
easy to work with.

### Can I use this as a library?

If you like to live on the edge you sure can, however I haven't written any unit tests. I'm just following the book, so I enter their testing data and see
that the results match. If anyone wants to add tests and make this "useful" - create a PR!
